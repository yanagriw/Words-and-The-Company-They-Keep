    <p>In this exercise, we explore word associations within English and Czech texts using the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) method. 
        The task involves analyzing consecutive word pairs as well as distant word pairs (separated by at least one word but no more than 50 words) from the given datasets. 
        Our objective is to compute the PMI for all possible word pairs, filtering out those where either word appears less than 10 times in the corpus. 
        We then rank these pairs to identify the strongest associations, presenting the top 20 pairs for both datasets and both types of word pairings.</p>
    <p>Negative PMI values, such as those observed for common pairs like "the" and ",", indicate a lower than expected co-occurrence based on the individual word frequencies. 
        This suggests that these words appear together less frequently than would be predicted from their individual occurrences across the texts.</p>
