    <p>In this task, I expanded the analysis to classify tags (parts of speech) from the same dataset, focusing on tags appearing more than 5 times.

    <p>Class involving WDT, WRB, VBG, WP: This class groups together wh-determiners (WDT), wh-adverbs (WRB), gerunds (VBG), and wh-pronouns (WP), suggesting a close association in forming interrogative or relative clauses. Their co-occurrence reflects syntactic structures involving questions or relative descriptions, which is interesting as it combines elements of verb forms with those typically involved in interrogative or relative functions.</p>
    <p>Class with NNP, SYM, NNPS, FW: This class combines proper nouns (NNP), symbols (SYM), plural proper nouns (NNPS), and foreign words (FW). The presence of proper nouns alongside symbols and foreign words indicates a likely use of names and special terms within certain contexts, possibly technical or academic texts where foreign terms and symbols are prevalent alongside specific names.</p>
    <p>Class grouping JJ, CD, JJS, JJR, RBS, RBR, WP$: Adjectives (JJ), cardinal numbers (CD), superlative (JJS) and comparative (JJR) adjectives, superlative (RBS) and comparative (RBR) adverbs, and possessive wh-pronouns (WP$) form a diverse class. This mixture highlights descriptive elements in the data, combining quantity, quality, and possession in detailing nouns, reflecting a rich use of descriptive language.</p>
